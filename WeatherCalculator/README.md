### Project 5 - Weather Calculator

<br/>
The aim of this project is to create a project in which the temperature given in the Celcius unit, which is the homework given in the fifth week, is in Kelvin and Fahrenheit units, and the temperature given from the Celcius unit is increased and a change in Kelvin and Fahrenheit is required to be observed. In the fifth week, component architecture and useState structure were explained on React, but component architecture was explained over class component instead of functional component. For a front-end developer starting from scratch, my advice is to continue with React through the functional component. Because if he has not received any training related to OOP at this time, he will learn most of the information by heart without understanding the logic. In their documentation in future versions of React, they say that using functional components makes the project more readable, and that's why they recommend it. That's why most projects written in React today are written with functional components instead of class components. Although there are buttons on the project that increase or decrease the temperature, it also makes instantaneous measurements over Kelvin and Fahrenheit in case of temperature changes. On my Youtube channel, I explained the project by doing it with you from scratch to completion.

### Proje 5 - Weather Calculator

<br/>

Bu projedeki amaç , beşinci haftada verilen ödev olan Celcius biriminden verilen sıcaklığın Kelvin ve Fahrenheit biriminden değerlerinin ne olduğu ve Celcius biriminden verilen sıcaklık artarak Kelvin ve Fahrenheit üzerinde değişiklik gözlemlenmesi istenen bir proje oluşturmaktır. Beşinci haftada React üzerinde component mimarisi ve useState yapısı anlatılmıştır fakat component mimarisi , functional component olarak anlatılmak yerine class component üzerinden anlatılmıştır. Sıfırdan başlayan bir Front-End developer için benim tavsiyem functional component üzerinden React e devam etmesidir. Çünkü eğer bu sırada OOP ile alakalı herhangi bir eğitim almamışsa çoğu bilgileri mantığını anlamadan ezbere öğrenecektir. React in ileriki versiyonlarındaki dökümantasyonlarında da functional component kullanmanın projeyi daha okunabilir kıldığını ve bu yüzden tavsiye ettiklerini söylemektedir. Bu yüzden de günümüzde çoğu React ile yazılan projeler , class compnent yerine functional component ile yazılmaktadır. Proje üzerinde sıcaklığı artırıp azaltan butonlar bulunmakla beraber sıcaklık değişimlerinde ise Kelvin ve Fahrenheit üzerinden de ölçümü anlık yapmaktadır. Youtube kanalımda ise projeyi sıfırdan bitişe kadar sizlerle birlikte yaparak anlattım.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
